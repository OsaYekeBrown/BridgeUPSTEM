# CLOUD FRACTION PROJECT ☁️


Clouds play an important role in Earth’s climate and can warm or cool the atmosphere depending on their particular characteristics and on when and where they form. Computer models of Earth’s future climate suffer from uncertainties linked to the challenge of predicting cloud cover and how the effects of clouds might evolve as the planet warms. Thus, this project aims to visualize cloud fraction overtime to see the change in cloud fraction overtime and make inference on how these trends relate to climate change
